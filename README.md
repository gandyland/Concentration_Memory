# Concentration_Memory
For the Concentration/Memory Game

I tried to use mostly Javascript in this whole project. The only html I have is for the title and referencing the board and the only css I have is for the background the board and the individual cards themselves. Other than that it's almost all Javascript.
The issue with this however was I probably took too long on this and didn't get around to adding more functions like making transitions and adding a timer. This was poor planning considering how bare-bones my game is.


User Stories:
As a user I should be able to turn a cards over to begin the matching game.
As a user this first card should stay turned over until I have picked a second card.
As a user I should be able to turn over a second card to see if it matches the first card.
As a user the cards should turn back over if they do not match so I can continue trying to finish the game.
As a user the cards should stay turned over if they do match so I can continue trying to get all the matches.
As a user once I have mathced all the cards there should be a way to reset the board to play another game.
